            <h2>1.1. About Money: Common Usage and Functionality.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p id = "largeSum">Have you ever wondered about the complex system of <strong>money</strong>? Money in its simplest form is a medium to trade for goods such as a computer, a TV, or even a house, but it has more confusing subelements. From <strong>gross income</strong> (money before taxes) and <strong>net income</strong> (money after taxes and other deductions), to monthly bills, taxes themselves, to investing and saving — all this can seem a bit confusing at first. However, we can break this down a little bit.</p>

            <p id="smallSum"> We already know that money is a direct way that goods are traded in modern society, so what's the purpose of <strong>taxes</strong>?<strong> <br> <br> Taxes</strong> are mandatory payments to the government to fund government agencies and all parts of our society — as well as even yourself (especially when you're older). Your taxes are used to contribute to Social Security (retirement and aid), National Defense, Medicare, and other agencies. These taxes are used typically when you start gaining <strong>income</strong> (money gained regularly from jobs or investments). Though money is just used for the exchange of produced goods and entertainment, taxes are essential to this process as they are similar to an investment in society and help keep everything running while assisting those later on in life.</p>

            <h2>1.2. Money Management Methods and How to Save.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p id = "largeSum">Understanding the usage of money is only part of the story; understanding how to <strong>manage</strong> and <strong>save</strong> money is the missing half of our chronicle.</p>

            <p id="smallSum">Saving money is essential whether you want to retire with plenty of money, or save for a new home, and saving money is something you have to start at a relatively young age. This is due to something called <strong>interest</strong> (amount of extra money accumulated over time, typically calculated in percentages). You can get interest by investing in <strong>credit unions</strong>, <strong>government bonds</strong>, or <strong>savings accounts</strong>.<br><br><strong>Credit unions</strong> are non-profit, member-owned institutions that allow for deposits, send out loans, and give profits back to members by offering higher saving rates and lower interest rates for borrowing money. <strong>Government bonds</strong> are essentially giving money to the government, with the government's promise of return along with some interest. <strong>Savings accounts</strong> are accounts that hold your money and give you <b>compound interest</b>. Compound interest is interest stacking on interest — for example, if you have $100 now, next year you may have $105, but the year after that you may gain $110.25. In simple terms, all these methods are just letting you gain money over time due to interest, in turn for your participation or some of your money in the present moment.<br><br>Over time, you gain more and more money passively, and then you have to worry about managing that money. A general rule of thumb for <strong>managing money</strong> is 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and roughly 20% for investments/emergency funds.</p>
