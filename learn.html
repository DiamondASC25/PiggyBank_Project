<h2> 1.1. About Money: Common Usage and Functionality.</h2>
</div>

<div class = “content”>
<p> Have you ever wondered about the complex system of money? Money in its simplest form is a medium to trade for goods such as a computer or a tv or even a house, but it has more confusing subelements. From gross income (money before taxes) and net income (money after taxes), to monthly bills, taxes themselves, to investing and saving; all this can seem a bit confusing at first. However, we can break this down a little bit.</p>

<p>  We already know that money is a direct way that goods are traded in modern society, so whats the purpose of taxes?</p>

    <p><strong>Taxes </strong> are mandatory payments to the government to fund government agencies to fund all parts of our society as well as even yourself (especially when your older). Your taxes are used to contribute to Social Security (retirement and aid), National Defense, Medicare, and other agencies. These taxes are used typically when you start gaining income (money gained regularly from jobs or investments). Though money is just used for the exchange of produced goods and entertainment, taxes are essential to this process as they are similar to an investment in society and helps keep everything running as well as assisting those later on in life.</p>
